## General
Reading daily news, researching stock, writing down memo. This little virtual assistant will make your life a bit easier. Using the voice recognition package in python, you can tell him to show you daily news, the current time just using your voice. 

Using the newspaper package, this assistant summarizes daily news so you donâ€™t even need to click open the news link.


## Install requires packages:
Use the package manager pip to install the requirenment package
```bash
pip install -r requirenments.txt
```

## How to use
After install the required packages, click main.py to open the program 
The program will show the current time and ask for the user input

Now the user can type some command, such as 'Can I get news for today'


![option](https://github.com/kennetchau/My-virtual-assistance-/blob/master/examples/newseg.PNG)


or 'Hows the stock market today'.


![option](https://github.com/kennetchau/My-virtual-assistance-/blob/master/examples/stockeg.PNG)


The program will find the keyword of the line and open the respective function. If you get lost, just type help 


To use voice recognition, type settings and press y when the program ask you 'Would you like to use voice recognition'
![option](https://github.com/kennetchau/My-virtual-assistance-/blob/master/examples/voiceeg.PNG)
and just say anything!

## Roadmap
Currently, the program recognize the user input by keywords. Which means if the user enter something that is not hardcoded in the script. The program will not recognize it, I am currently working on a concept to incorporate a deep learning chatbot to make the virtual assistant more human like. I am also working on the concept on giving the assistance a voice, for instance the voice of google assistance.
