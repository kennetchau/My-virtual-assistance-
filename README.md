# My-virtual-assistance-
A simple script for a virtual assistance, included function such as searching up stock, getting the time, saving notes and others 

Using package such as yfinance to get stock info and SpeechRecognition for speech recognition

Using packages such as matploblib to plot stock prices and pandas to read and write csv files 

In the future, I would like to include a machine learning chatbot to bring a more human like response and a buddy to talk to if you're bored
